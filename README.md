## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.x üêç and some common machine learning libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-learning-algorithms.git
    cd Machine-learning-algorithms
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Navigate to the folder of the algorithm you are interested in and follow the instructions provided in the respective README files or notebooks.

For example, to run the Linear Regression example:
```sh
cd 2. Linear Regression
python linear_regression.py
```
